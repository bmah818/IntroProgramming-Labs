      " the past five years, you spent your time in Egypt, exploring hidden"
      " tunnels inside pyramids. You knew there would be a room full of"
      " treasures, and you wanted to find it so you could become rich."
      " You were able to find the room full of treasures, and you found a"
      " diamond that was double the size of diamonds you would normally find."
      " You quickly hid it in your backpack, not wanting anyone to see what you"
      " found. Days pass and you get the diamond appraised. It's worth $100"
      " million. You quickly make an excuse to your team that helped uncover"
      " the treasure room and you board a flight to New York, where you are"
      " planning to auction it. After a couple hours into the flight, the pilots"
      " lose control and the plane comes diving down into a deserted island"
      " and you lose consciousness...")
